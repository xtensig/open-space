## How To Use Repo Guidance

Before acting on a user request:

- Read every file under `.agents/rules/`.
- Read every skill under `.agents/skills/` that matches the request.
- If a nearer subtree `AGENTS.md` exists for the files you are touching, read it as scoped guidance in addition to this file.
- If context is compacted or auto-cleaned, read the relevant rules and skills again.
- If the task is large research or a long implementation, keep a temporary scratch file for important findings and delete it before finishing.

Rules are always-on and must always be followed. Skills are loaded by topic.

## Skill Routing

Always load these skills:

- `ss14-naming-conventions`
- `ss14-ecs-prototypes`
- `ss14-upstream-maintenance`

If writing or editing C# gameplay code:

- `ss14-ecs-components`
- `ss14-ecs-entities`
- `ss14-ecs-prototypes`
- `ss14-ecs-systems`
- `ss14-events`
- `ss14-prediction`

If the C# change is large or the task needs reviewable notes:

- `ss14-documentation-writing`

If the code touches hot paths, `Update()`, or frequently raised events:

- `ss14-standard-optimizations`

If the task adds or changes player-facing text:

- `ss14-localization-strings`
- `ss14-localization-code` when the change also touches `Loc.GetString(...)`, `LocId`, popup text, or localized component fields

If the task touches network events, `NetEntity`, replicated state routing, or shared/server/client message flow:

- `ss14-netcode`

If the task touches `Appearance`, `GenericVisualizer`, visual state enums, or sprite-layer toggles:

- `ss14-graphics-generic-visualizer-appearance`

If the task touches sprites, RSI metadata, overlays, shaders, or custom client visual effects:

- `ss14-sprite-overlays-shaders`

If the task adds tests or you need to choose the right test layer:

- `ss14-tests-authoring`

If the task is about learning or explaining SS14 architecture, first features, or where code belongs:

- `ss14-prototype-basics`
- `ss14-ecs-basics`
- `ss14-client-server-shared`

If the task is about bug hunting, VV, logs, breakpoints, or runtime inspection:

- `ss14-debugging-workflow`
- `ss14-common-api-patterns`

If the task touches common gameplay helpers such as entity-system methods, spawning, prototypes, audio, popups, or random:

- `ss14-common-api-patterns`
- `ss14-audio` when the work changes audio routing, sound assets, sound collections, or predicted sound feedback

If the task ports code or assets from another repository, or needs license or attribution guidance:

- `ss14-porting-and-licensing`

If the task is about how to use AI tools effectively in this repo:

- `ss14-ai-workflow`

If the task touches atmospherics, gases, fire, pressure, pipes, atmos devices, or atmos UI:

- `ss14-atmos`

If the task touches transforms, coordinates, grids, maps, anchoring, movement, collision, fixtures, or physics:

- `ss14-transform-physics`

If the task touches PVS, visibility, network interest, PVS filters, PVS overrides, or code that must tolerate entities leaving PVS:

- `ss14-pvs`

If the task edits XAML windows, controls, code-behind, or client UI layout:

- `ss14-ui-xaml`

If the task edits BUI flows, UI keys, BUI state/messages, or `BoundUserInterface` classes:

- `ss14-ui-bui`

If the task edits EUI flows, `BaseEui`, `EuiStateBase`, `EuiMessageBase`, or admin/debug UI sessions:

- `ss14-ui-eui`

If the task touches database models, EF Core contexts, migrations, persistence services, or schema compatibility:

- `ss14-databases-migrations`

If the task touches NPCs, HTN, pathfinding, steering, mob AI, AI debug overlays, or NPC prototypes:

- `ss14-npc-ai`

If a task spans multiple gameplay/resource areas and you need a broad map first:

- `ss14-gameplay-feature`
- `ss14-prototypes-locale`

If another skill clearly matches the request, load it too.

## Scope

This repository is a large Space Station 14 fork with a clear split between gameplay code, client code, and content data:

- `Content.Shared/`: shared gameplay logic, networked components, shared events, predicted systems.
- `Content.Server/`: server-authoritative simulation, round logic, persistence, and server-only behavior.
- `Content.Client/`: client visuals, overlays, XAML UI, BUIs, and client-only polish.
- `Resources/`: prototypes, locale, maps, textures, audio, and other content data.
- `Content.Tests/`: fast unit/content tests.
- `Content.IntegrationTests/`: game/integration coverage.

## Working Style

- Make the smallest change that fully solves the task.
- Respect existing folder and system boundaries; do not create new `Misc` buckets.
- Do not mix feature work, bug fixes, refactors, and mapping sweeps unless the task clearly requires it.
- Read nearby systems, prototypes, and tests before introducing a new pattern.
- Prefer expanding an established feature path over inventing a parallel architecture.

## Engine Boundaries

- Do not edit `RobustToolbox/` or other engine-side files unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Prefer fixing gameplay behavior in content code before assuming an engine change is needed.
- For fork-only behavior, prefer extending `_OpenSpace` or another clearly fork-scoped area instead of hiding fork logic in unrelated upstream files.
- When you must touch an upstream content file, keep the diff narrow and preserve surrounding structure and style.
- When adding or changing OpenSpace-specific code in a file outside any `_OpenSpace` path, mark it:
  - Single added or changed line: append `// OpenSpace` as an inline comment.
  - Multiple lines: wrap with block markers:

```csharp
// OpenSpace edit start
...code here...
// OpenSpace edit end
```

- Keep edit-marker ranges as narrow as practical. For files that do not use `//` comments, use the native comment syntax while preserving `OpenSpace edit start`, `OpenSpace edit end`, and `OpenSpace`.

## Assembly Placement

- Put shared data, shared events, networked state, and predicted logic in `Content.Shared/`.
- Put server-only authority and non-predicted server simulation in `Content.Server/`.
- Put client-only visuals, overlays, XAML, and BUI front-ends in `Content.Client/`.
- Do not make `Content.Shared` depend on client-only or server-only projects.

## ECS Rules

- Keep components data-only. Put gameplay logic in entity systems.
- Prefer entity-system public methods over method events.
- Public entity-system APIs that operate on entities should usually take `Entity<T?>` or `EntityUid` first and call `Resolve(...)` early.
- Prefer `Entity<T?>` over parallel `(EntityUid uid, T component)` parameters when the call site already has the pair.
- Prefer `[Dependency]` fields over ad-hoc `IoCManager.Resolve(...)` inside methods.
- Use `EntityUid?` for optional entities; do not use `EntityUid.Invalid` as a "missing" sentinel.
- Use `sealed`, `abstract`, `static`, or `[Virtual]` on new classes where appropriate.
- Prefer prototypes over enums for in-game content types.
- Use `ProtoId<T>` or `EntProtoId` instead of raw prototype ID strings in data fields and static references.
- Prefer `[DataField]` without string field names on new code unless serializer compatibility or a non-default data name is required.

## Interaction Flow

Use the repo-standard action flow for interactions and state-changing gameplay APIs:

- `OnEvent(...)` is the event entry point.
- `TryDoSomething(...)` is the public action API.
- `CanDoSomething(...)` checks whether the action is allowed.
- `DoSomething(...)` or the execution part of `TryDoSomething(...)` performs the mutation.

More detail lives in `.agents/rules/ss14-interaction-flow.md`.

## Naming

- Event handlers should use `On...` names.
- Public action methods should prefer `Try...`.
- Check methods should prefer `Can...`.
- Dependency fields should use the existing underscore-prefixed style such as `_popup`, `_hands`, `_audio`.
- Use specific `kebab-case` localization IDs.
- Keep new prototype IDs, event names, and component names aligned with nearby conventions rather than inventing new suffixes.

## Prediction And Networking

When a local player action should feel immediate, check whether it should be predicted.

- Predicted systems and their relevant components belong in `Content.Shared/`.
- Shared predicted components should use `NetworkedComponent`, `AutoGenerateComponentState`, and `AutoNetworkedField` where appropriate.
- Dirty networked state every time authoritative data changes. Use `DirtyField(...)` when field deltas make sense.
- Use predicted APIs such as `PopupPredicted`, `PopupClient`, `PlayPredicted`, predicted BUI messages, and predicted spawn/delete helpers instead of server-only equivalents.
- If a shared system needs client/server special cases, keep a shared base plus both server and client concrete systems.
- Never add `NetworkedComponent` to purely server-only or purely client-only components.
- Be careful with predicted randomness and reference-type networked fields.
- Prefer maximum practical prediction support for new player-facing systems instead of adding prediction as after-the-fact cleanup.

## UI

- Prefer XAML over constructing full UIs in C#.
- Keep `.xaml` paired with `.xaml.cs` and the relevant BUI/client system.
- Reuse existing style classes and `FancyWindow` patterns before adding new stylesheet rules.
- Localize all player-visible UI text.
- When the client already has the needed networked component state, prefer reading it instead of duplicating it in separate BUI state objects unless the existing pattern clearly requires both.

## Resources

- Put prototypes under the most specific existing subtree in `Resources/Prototypes/`.
- If you introduce a new prototype parent tree, put parent prototypes in `base.yml` and variants in sibling files.
- Keep entity prototype field order as `type`, `abstract`, `parent`, `id`, `categories`, `name`, `suffix`, `description`, `components`.
- Do not insert blank lines between `- type:` entries inside a `components:` list.
- Separate prototype blocks with one blank line.
- Prefer `suffix` for spawn-menu distinctions instead of changing prototype `name`.
- Use sound collections/specifiers and sprite specifiers instead of ad-hoc raw asset strings in code when reusable content is intended.
- Keep RSI `meta.json` ordered as `version`, `license`, `copyright`, `size`, `states` with 4-space indentation.

## Localization

- Every player-facing string must be localized.
- Add or update FTL entries under `Resources/Locale/`, usually starting with `en-US`.
- Use specific `kebab-case` localization IDs.
- Do not compare localized strings or expose raw enum `ToString()` output to players.
- Treat localization as mandatory work, not optional polish.

## Rider MCP

If Rider MCP is available in the environment, prefer it over shell equivalents for search, navigation, edits, and file diagnostics.

Preferred order:

1. Search and navigation: symbol/text/file/tree tools.
2. Reading and diagnostics: file reads, symbol info, file problems.
3. Solution structure: modules, dependencies, run configurations.
4. Edits and refactors: replace text, rename refactorings, reformat.
5. Verification: build the affected project, then run targeted configurations when available.

If Rider MCP is not available, use the normal shell/file tools.

## Testing And Validation

Pick the smallest verification that meaningfully covers the change.

- Baseline build: `dotnet restore` then `dotnet build --configuration DebugOpt --no-restore /m`
- Unit/content tests: `dotnet test --no-build --configuration DebugOpt Content.Tests/Content.Tests.csproj`
- Integration tests: `dotnet test --no-build --configuration DebugOpt Content.IntegrationTests/Content.IntegrationTests.csproj`
- YAML/resource edits: `dotnet run --project Content.YAMLLinter/Content.YAMLLinter.csproj`
- RSI edits: `py -3 Schemas/validate_rsis.py Resources`
- Gameplay/UI fixes should ideally be verified in-game; if you cannot do that locally, say so explicitly.
- If code touches prototypes or FTL, run the YAML linter.
- If code touches C#, build the affected project or the repo slice that covers it.
- If code touches the client, run or otherwise verify the client path when possible and call out when runtime verification was not possible.

More detail lives in `.agents/rules/ss14-testing-and-validation.md`.

## PR Expectations

- Keep feature work, bug fixes, refactors, and mapping changes separate when practical.
- Do not force-push or rewrite history unless explicitly asked.
- For player-visible changes, prepare PR-ready changelog text in `:cl:` format when useful, but do not hand-edit generated changelog artifacts unless the task explicitly asks for it.
- If a change is breaking for APIs, namespaces, or prototype IDs, call it out clearly.
